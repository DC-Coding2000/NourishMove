      <h2>The Origins of Yoga</h2>
      <p>
        Yoga is an ancient practice that originated in India over 5,000 years
        ago and has evolved into a complex system of physical, mental, and
        spiritual practices.
      </p>

      <h2>Origins</h2>
      <p>
        Yoga is believed to have originated on the banks of Lake Kantisarovar in
        the Himalayas, where Shiva, the first yogi, taught the Saptarishis, or
        "seven sages".
      </p>

      <h2>Early Records</h2>
      <p>
        The earliest written records of yoga are found in the Vedas, ancient
        Indian texts dating back to around 1500 BCE.
      </p>

      <h2>Patanjali</h2>
      <p>
        Patanjali, who wrote the Yoga Sutras around 200 BCE, is considered one
        of the most influential teachers in the history of yoga.
      </p>

      <h2>Hatha Yoga</h2>
      <p>
        Hatha yoga, which includes asanas (postures) and pranayama (breathing
        exercises), emerged between the ninth and 11th centuries.
      </p>

      <h2>Modern Yoga</h2>
      <p>
        In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Swami Vivekananda introduced
        yoga to the West, and yoga masters began traveling to the West to
        attract followers.
      </p>

      <h2>Today</h2>
      <p>
        Yoga is practiced all over the world, and there are many different
        styles and approaches. Some people practice yoga for its physical and
        mental health benefits, while others practice it as a spiritual or
        religious practice.
